import { Meta, Story } from '@storybook/addon-docs';
import * as stories from './CoButton.stories.js';
import CoButton from "./CoButton";


<Meta title="Demo/Button" component={CoButton} />

# CoButton

I can define a story with the function imported from CSF:

<Story story={stories.Primary} />

And I can also embed arbitrary markdown & JSX in this file.
